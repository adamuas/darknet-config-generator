# Darknet Neural Network Configuration Generator
@author: Adamu A. S


## Motivation
If you have used darknet for one of your projects, you will understand also understand the pain of editing the config file when you want to modify your network, optimization, and image augmentation parameters. I implemented this to allow me to describe my neural network in a keras-like fashion and have a darknet config file generated.

Give it a try with your next darknet project :-)
